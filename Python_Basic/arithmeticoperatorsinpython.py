a=int(input())
#here we are reading input by using the "input()" function.
#"int()" is used to read the input in integer format coz by default input functions read in string type.
b=int(input())
print(a+b)
# this prints sum of a & b
print(a-b)
# this prints the difference of a & b i.e. a subtracted from b
print(a*b)
# this prints the product of a & b
print(a/b)
# this prints the quoteint when a is divided by b.
print(a**b)
#this prints a raise to the power b / in other words if u need square of 2 you can use 2**2
print(a%b)
# this prints the remainder when a is divide by b


#Here We have learn all the arithmetic operators.
